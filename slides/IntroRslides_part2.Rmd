# Subsetting and summarising using dplyr:

`dplyr`, has made a lot of data manipulation easier and clearer using **verbs** to filter and select different elements.

--

  * `select()` subsets columns based on their names.

--

  * `filter()` subsets rows based on their values.

--

  * `summarise()` calculates summary statistics.

--

  * `group_by()` groups variable for summarising.

--

  * `mutate()` adds new columns that are functions of existing variables. 

--

These verbs can be combined in powerful ways to do some really interesting data manipulation tasks! 



???

So far I've shown you the 'old school' method for extracting and filtering data. It is useful to know the layout of vectors and dataframes, especially if you end up writing your own `for loops` or functions in the future. 

However, the package, `dplyr`, has made a lot of data manipulation easier and clearer using **verbs** to filter and select different elements.

  * `select()` subsets columns based on their names.
  * `filter()` subsets rows based on their values.
  * `summarise()` calculates summary statistics.
  * `group_by()` groups variable for summarising.
  * `mutate()` adds new columns that are functions of existing variables. 

These verbs can be combined in powerful ways to do some really interesting data manipulation tasks. 

---
# select

```{r Select columns lifeExp and pop using select()}

select(gapminder, lifeExp, pop)

```

---

# The pipe operator

* `%>%` = **"and then"**

```{r Select the columns lifeExp and country using select()}

gapminder %>%
  select(lifeExp, country)

```


???

This is really useful because it means you can manipulate your data without having to store new data frames for each step. It also means you never comprimise the original data. 

---
# Assign your output to a new data frame


```{r Create a new data frame lifeExp_by_country with the columns lifeExp and country}

lifeExp_by_country <- gapminder %>%
  select(lifeExp, country)

head(lifeExp_by_country)

```

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Exercises Part I


---
## 1. Run the following line of code, what does the minus do?

```{r Using - to remove columns, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  select(-c(lifeExp, country))

```

---
## 2. Select the columns `country`, `continent` and `gdpPercap` from the data frame. 

```{r Select the columns country, continent and gdpPercap using select, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  select("country", "continent", "gdpPercap")

```

---
## 3. Write 2 ways to select all the columns except for year.

**Option 1**


```{r Write code for two ways to select all columns but year, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  select(c("country", "continent", "lifeExp", 
           "pop", "gdpPercap", "infant_mortality", 
           "fertility"))

```

--

**Option 2**

```{r Write code for two ways to select all columns but year 2, eval = FALSE}

gapminder %>%
  select(-year) #<<

```


---
# filter

* `filter`: subsetting rows

--

Logical Operator| Description
:--------------:|:------------:
        <       | Less Than
       <=       | Less Than or Equal To
       \>       | Greater Than
       >=       | Greater Than or Equal To
       ==       | Equal To
       !=       | Not Equal To
        &       | And
  %in% c(....)  | Membership **one in** a list of elements

???

We can use filter to pick out a particular country. N.B., if we are unsure of names we can always use `unique(gapminder$country)` to check spellings.

---

# Filter using double "="

* Filter a particular country:

```{r Use filter to pick out a particular country}

gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Yemen, Rep.") %>%
  head()

```

---

# Filter rows from a set of matches


```{r Use filter to filter row from a set of countries}

gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Jordan", "Oman",
                        "Syria", "Yemen, Rep."))

```

---
# Combining multiple filters

* You can add multiple filters with a comma.

```{r Add multiple filters with a comma}

gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Yemen, Rep.", year >= 1960 & year <= 1985)

```

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Exercises Part 2

---
## 1. What do these lines of code filter the data for?

```{r What does this code filter for, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", lifeExp > 70)

```

---
## 2. Filter the data for countries in "Asia" where the "lifeExp" was below 35  

```{r Filter the data for countries in Asia where lifeExp is less than 35, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia", lifeExp < 35)
  
```

---
## 3. Filter the data for observations where the gdpPercap was equal to 1000 or less. 

```{r Filter the data so that you only get entries where gdpPercap is equal to 1000 or less, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(gdpPercap <= 1000)
  
```

---
## 4. Filter using `%in%` for countries "Chile", "Argentina", "Uruguay", and "Peru" and year >= to 1992. 

```{r Filter the data for Chile Argentina Uruguay and Peru for years greater than or equal to 1992, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Chile", "Argentina", "Uruguay", "Peru") & year >= 1992)


```

---
## 5. Filter the data using `!=` to include the data from all continents apart from Europe. 

```{r Filter the data to inclue data from all continents apart from Europe, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  filter(continent != "Europe")

```

---
# summarise()

--

* `summarise()` uses existing R functions to calculate summary statistics. 

--

* mean lifeExp for all countries:

--

```{r Calculate the mean_lifeExp using summarise}

(lifeExp_stats <- gapminder %>%
                  summarise(
                    mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp) #<<
                    )
 )

```

---
# summarise() multiple summary statistics

* Calculate multiple summary statistics by separating using ","

```{r Use summarise to calculate mean_lifeExp, min_lifeExp, and max_lifeExp}

(lifeExp_stats <- gapminder %>%
                  summarise(
                    mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp), # mean #<<
                    min_lifeExp = min(lifeExp), # min #<<
                    max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp)) # max #<<
                    ) 


```

---

# group_by()

--

* `group_by()` used to group variables. 

--
* summarise min, mean, and max `lifeExp` per country

--

```{r Use group_by to group by country and then summarise}

(lifeExp_stats_country <- gapminder %>%
                             group_by(country) %>% #<<
                             summarise(
                                mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
                                min_lifeExp = min(lifeExp), 
                                max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp)
                                ))

```

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Exercises Part 3

---
## 1. What does the following bit of code do? 

```{r What does the following group_by summarise code do, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
      group_by(continent, year) %>%
      summarise(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap))


```

---
## 2. Group the data by country and summarise the minimum and maximum population sizes. 


```{r Group the data by country and create two new variables which summarise the minimum and maximum pop, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(min_pop = min(pop),
            max_pop = max(pop)) %>%
            head(8)
          
```

---
## 3. Group the data by continent and year. Summarise the max and min population.

```{r Summarise maximum and Minimum population by continent and year, eval = TRUE}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(min_pop = min(pop),
            max_pop = max(pop)) %>%
            head(8)
          
```


---

# The pipe function %>%

```{r, out.width = 570, out.height = 420, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "The pipe function"}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/assembly_line.jpg")
```


* The pipe function `%>%` allows you to combine multiple data wrangling steps

???

We've seen an example of the pipe function  in the `group_by()` example above.  which will be carried out in order. 

I like to think of the pipe function as the separator of different jobs on an assembly line. 



* Tree (raw data) -> Planks (grouped data) -> Bird House (summarised data)

You begin with your raw data (e.g. tree), it then goes through the pipe to the next station where it is modified in some way (e.g. cut into planks), it can then pass to another station where it can be further modified, and so on and so forth, until Voila! you have your final product (e.g. a bird house).

---
# The pipe function in action!


Let's calculate life expectancy in Yemen pre 1980. First we take the `gapminder` data

```{r Yemen Life Expectancy pre 1980}


yemen_pre1980_mean_lifeExp <- gapminder %>% #<<
    filter(country == "Yemen, Rep.", year <1980) %>% 
    select(lifeExp) %>% 
    summarise(meanlifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

```

---
# The pipe function in action!


**And then**, we filter for Yemen and years less than 1980.

```{r Yemen Life Expectancy pre 1980 1}


yemen_pre1980_mean_lifeExp <- gapminder %>%
    filter(country == "Yemen, Rep.", year <1980) %>%  #<<
    select(lifeExp) %>% 
    summarise(meanlifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

```


---
# The pipe function in action!


**And then** we can select our column of interest `lifeExp`

```{r Yemen Life Expectancy pre 1980 2}


yemen_pre1980_mean_lifeExp <- gapminder %>%
    filter(country == "Yemen, Rep.", year <1980) %>% 
    select(lifeExp) %>% #<<
    summarise(meanlifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

```

---
# The pipe function in action!


**And then** we can use summarise to calculate the mean `lifeExp`

```{r Yemen Life Expectancy pre 1980 3}


yemen_pre1980_mean_lifeExp <- gapminder %>%
    filter(country == "Yemen, Rep.", year <1980) %>% 
    select(lifeExp) %>% 
    summarise(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) #<<


yemen_pre1980_mean_lifeExp

```


---
# Looking at a slice()


`slice()` chooses rows by their position within the group, e.g. minimum `lifeExp`.

```{r Using group_by and slice: min lifeExp}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  slice(which.min(lifeExp)) 

```

---
# Looking at a slice()

* Which country had the highest life Expectancy in each year?

```{r Using group_by and slice: max lifeExp}

gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  slice(which.max(lifeExp))

```

---
# Mutate

  * `mutate()` adds new columns that are functions of existing variables. 
  
--

```{r Creating a new variable gdp}

(gapminder <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp = gdpPercap*pop)) #<<



```

--

  * gdp is useful... but it's also a huge number! Which makes it difficult to compare. 
  
???

This is useful if we want to look at the overall gdp, but it is also a huge number which is difficult to compare among countries in a meaningful way.

---
# Joining data frames: when one data frame is not enough

* Our data is often spread out over several data frames!

--

* We can **join** these data frames together using a variety of `join` functions from the `dplyr` package.

--

![](pictures/explaining_joins.jpg)

???

It is often the case that our data is spread out over several data frames that we are interested in combining. We can **join** these data frames together using a variety of `join` functions from the `dplyr` package.



Let's walk through the different types of joins using a simple example. 

---
# Joining data

**Person Table**

```{r}

(person_table <- data.frame(Person_ID = c("Person1", "Person2"), 
                           Name = c("Jane Doe", "John Smith"), 
                           Job_ID = c("Job_1", "NA")))
```

--

**Job Table**  
   
```{r}                           
(job_table <- data.frame(Job_ID = c("Job_1", "Job_2"), 
                        Job_Name = c("Programmer", "Statistician")))
```

???

Let's say we have two data frames of "tables" we are interesting in joining together: `person_table`, which contains the information about the employee (`Person_ID`, `Name` and `Job_ID`) and the `job_table`, which contains information about the job (`Job_ID` and `Job_Name`). We can join the two table on the matched ID column `Job_ID`.

---
# Inner join:


```{r}
person_table
```

```{r}
job_table
```

--

* `inner_join:` only rows where there is a match. 

```{r Inner join example, warning = FALSE}

inner_join(x = person_table, y = job_table, by = "Job_ID")

```

???
With an inner join, rows where there’s a match on the join criteria are returned. Unmatched rows are excluded. Don't worry about the warning message. It is just pointing out that the column `Job_ID` in the person table has a different number of levels. 

---
# Left join:


```{r}
person_table
```

```{r}
job_table
```

--

* `left_join:` All rows on the left side of join. 

--

* Only rows from the right side where there's a match on the left. 

--

```{r Left join example, warning = FALSE}


left_join(x = person_table, y = job_table, by = "Job_ID")

```

???

With a left join, you get all rows from the left side of the join even if there are no matching rows on the right side. You only get rows from the right side where there’s a join match to a row on the left.

---
# Right join:

```{r}
person_table
```

```{r}
job_table
```

--

* `right_join:` Rows from the left side only where there is a match on the right. 

--

* All rows from the right side of the join.

```{r Right join example, warning = FALSE}

right_join(x = person_table, y = job_table, by = "Job_ID")

```

???

With a right join, you get all the rows from the left side of the join only where there’s a match on the right. You get all rows from the right side of the join even if there are no matching rows on the left.

---
# Full join

```{r}
person_table
```

```{r}
job_table
```

--

* `full_join:` All rows from the left.

* All rows from the right, **Joined** where the criteria matches. NAs where no matches.

```{r Full join example, warning = FALSE}

full_join(x = person_table, y = job_table, by = "Job_ID")

```

???

With a full join, you get all rows from the left and right hand side, joined where the criteria matches.

---
# Creating a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df

* Let's look at the per capita GDP in a way that's more meaningful.

--

* Let's create `gdpPercap_rel`, that is the `gdpPercap` of the country **relative** to the UK's `gdpPercap` of that same year.

--

* How? Country A: `gdpPercap` divided by UK's `gdpPercap` in the same year.




???

We can do this by dividing `gdpPercap` by the United Kingdom's `gdpPercap`, making sure that we always divide two numbers that are from the same year. To do this we need to first:



---
# Creating a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df

* Create a new dataframe `uk_gdpPercap_df`

```{r Make a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df 1}

uk_gdpPercap_df <- gapminder %>%   #<<
  filter(country == "United Kingdom") %>% 
  select(gdpPercap, year) %>% 
  rename(uk_gdpPercap = gdpPercap) 


```

---
# Creating a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df

* Filter the rows for `country == "United Kingdom"`.

```{r Make a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df 2}

uk_gdpPercap_df <- gapminder %>%  
  filter(country == "United Kingdom") %>% #<<
  select(gdpPercap, year) %>% 
  rename(uk_gdpPercap = gdpPercap) 

```

---
# Creating a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df

* Select the columns `gdpPercap` and `year`.

```{r Make a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df 3}

uk_gdpPercap_df <- gapminder %>%  
  filter(country == "United Kingdom") %>%
  select(gdpPercap, year) %>% #<<
  rename(uk_gdpPercap = gdpPercap) 


```


---
# Creating a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df

* Rename the variable `gdpPercap` to `uk_gdpPercap`.

```{r Make a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df 4}

uk_gdpPercap_df <- gapminder %>%  
  filter(country == "United Kingdom") %>% 
  select(gdpPercap, year) %>% 
  rename(uk_gdpPercap = gdpPercap) #<<

```

---
# Creating a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df

* Inspect the data frame.

```{r Make a new data frame uk_gdpPercap_df 5}

uk_gdpPercap_df <- gapminder %>%  
  filter(country == "United Kingdom") %>% 
  select(gdpPercap, year) %>% 
  rename(uk_gdpPercap = gdpPercap)

head(uk_gdpPercap_df) #<<

```


---
## Joining `uk_gdpPercap_df` to the `gapminder` data frame

* We want to divide all the other country's `gdpPercap` by the UK `gdpPercap` in that same year.
 
--
 
* We can match the two data frames using a `left_join` on the common variable, `year`.

--

```{r Join the gapminder and uk_gdpPercap_df data frames}

gapminder <- left_join(gapminder, uk_gdpPercap_df, by = "year")

names(gapminder)

```

 


---
# Calculating the relative GDP per capita

```{r Make a new variable gdpPercap_rel}

gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_rel = gdpPercap/uk_gdpPercap) #<<

```

* Doublechecking our calculations... Is the United Kindom relative gdp always 1?


```{r Doublechecking our calculation of gdpPercap_rel worked}

gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "United Kingdom") %>%
  select(gdpPercap_rel) %>%
  head()

```

???

We can doublecheck that our calculation worked by filtering for the United Kingdom to check that the relative gdp per capita is 1. 

Now that we have the `gdpPercap` and `uk_gdpPercap` matched up, we can calculate the relative GDP per capita `gdpPercap_rel`. 


---
## How many countries had a smaller gdp per capita than the UK each year?

```{r How many countries had a smaller gdpPercapita}
